BATTinfo, but simpler. Everything you need, nothing you don't.
This version of BATTinfo focuses on decreasing file size, and making the experience feel more clean and without clutter!

**IMPORTANT:** There is a high possibility a recent windows update completely bricked BATTinfo and BATTinfo Classic. I haven't done any tests on Windows 11 **yet**, however the script no longer works as expected on Windows 10. Feel free to send feedback while I work on a fix.
